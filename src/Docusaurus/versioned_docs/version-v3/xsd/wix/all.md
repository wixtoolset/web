  <dt>Remarks</dt>
  <dd><p>Warning: this is intended for testing purposes only. Shipping a patch with all changes negates the benefits of using patch families for including only specific changes.</p><p>Because changing the ProductCode is not supported in a patch, the ProductCode property is automatically removed from the transform.</p></dd>
