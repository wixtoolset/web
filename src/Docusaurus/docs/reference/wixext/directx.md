# DirectX custom action

The [GetCapabilities](reference/schema/directx/getcapabilities.md) element in the [Directx schema](reference/schema/directx/index.md) schedules a custom action that detects DirectX capabilities and sets properties based on the results.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| WIX_DIRECTX_PIXELSHADERVERSION | Pixel shader version capability, expressed as major*100 + minor. For example, a shader model 3.0-compliant system would have a WIX_DIRECTX_PIXELSHADERVERSION value of 300. |
| WIX_DIRECTX_VERTEXSHADERVERSION | Vertex shader version capability, expressed as major*100 + minor. For example, a shader model 3.0-compliant system would have a WIX_DIRECTX_VERTEXSHADERVERSION value of 300. |
