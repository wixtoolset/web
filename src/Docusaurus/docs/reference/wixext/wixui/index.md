# WixUI dialog library

:::info
TODO: WiX v4 documentation is under development.
:::

WiX offers a set of built-in Windows Installer-based user interface for installation packages.

## Dialog sets

The WixUI dialog library contains the following built-in dialog sets that provide a familiar wizard-style setup user interface.

| WixUI id | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| WixUI_Advanced | The WixUI_Advanced dialog set provides the option of a one-click install like WixUI_Minimal, but it also allows directory and feature selection like other dialog sets if the user chooses to configure advanced options. |
| WixUI_FeatureTree | WixUI_FeatureTree is a simpler version of WixUI_Mondo that omits the setup type dialog. Instead, the wizard proceeds directly from the license agreement dialog to the feature customization dialog. WixUI_FeatureTree is more appropriate than WixUI_Mondo when your product installs all features by default. |
| WixUI_InstallDir | WixUI_InstallDir does not allow the user to choose what features to install, but it adds a dialog to let the user choose a directory where the entire product will be installed. |
| WixUI_Minimal | WixUI_Minimal is the simplest of the built-in WixUI dialog sets. Its sole dialog combines the welcome and license agreement dialogs and omits the feature customization dialog. WixUI_Minimal is appropriate when your product has no optional features and does not support changing the installation directory. |
| WixUI_Mondo | WixUI_Mondo includes a set dialogs that allow granular installation customization options. WixUI_Mondo is appropriate when some product features are not installed by default and there is a meaningful difference between typical and complete installs. Note: WixUI_Mondo uses [SetInstallLevel control events](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/setinstalllevel-controlevent) to set the install level when the user chooses *Typical* or *Complete*. For *Typical*, the install level is set to 3; for *Complete*, 1000. For details about feature levels and install levels, see [INSTALLLEVEL Property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/installlevel). |


### Adding a WixUI dialog set to your MSI package

To add a WixUI dialog set to your MSI package:

1. Add a reference to the `WixToolset.UI.wixext` WiX extension.
2. Add the `WixToolset.UI.wixext` WiX extension namespace to your WiX authoring.
3. Add the `WixUI` element to your WiX authoring.

For example:

```xml
<Wix xmlns="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs" xmlns:ui="http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs/ui">
  <Package ...>
      ...
      <ui:WixUI Id="WixUI_InstallDir" InstallDirectory="INSTALLFOLDER" />
  </Package>
</Wix>
```
