# Wix.exe command-line reference

The [Wix.exe .NET tool](../intro.md#nettool) provides a reassuringly old-fashioned command-line interface to WiX. Like the `dotnet` command-line tool that inspired it, Wix.exe has a number of command, some with subcommands, and both required and optional switches.

## Wix.exe commands

Wix.exe offers the following commands:
