title: The much exaggerated death of the WiX toolset

There has been some suggestion that the WiX toolset is a dead project because we have not released a drop to the SourceForge release point in a long while. Those fears are unfounded for three reasons. First, WiX v2 is stable so we are not expecting another build of that version unless a showstopper bug shows up. Second, weekly drops show up at the <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases">Weekly Releases</a> release point regularly. Finally, pushing to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105970">SourceForge release point</a> is a manual process for us and ends up a lower priority. In any case, development is still very much active and the <a href="/documentation/mailinglist/">wix-users mailing list</a> is still the best place to get your questions answered.
