title: WiX Toolset Source Code Moves To GitHub.com

The source code for the WiX Toolset can now be found on <a href="http://github.com/wixtoolset/">GitHub.com</a>.
Stable releases are still downloaded from CodePlex but we recommend using the download links from the
<a href="http://wixtoolset.org/releases/">Releases</a> page which will point to the correct location
should the downloads move.
