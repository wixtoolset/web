title: Votive works with Visual Studio 2008

Visual Studio 2008 has recently released and we are happy to announce that Votive is supported in both Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008. You can also install Votive side by side on both versions of Visual Studio. Support for Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 was added in build 3.0.3328 (which also works for Visual Studio 2008 RTM) and the final Visual Studio 2008 RTM bits are in a build &gt;= 3.0.3607, which is available on the <a href="/releases/">weekly releases</a> page.
