## Request WiX Toolset Assignment Agreement

Here's the information from your GitHub account that will be used for your assignment agreement:

* GitHub user name: **{{login}}**
* Name: **{{name}}**
* Company name: **{{company}}**
* E-mail address: **{{email}}**

Please make sure the information is accurate and complete, as the assignment agreement is a legal document. That means your name should be your legal name, not a pseudonym, and that if your contribution is subject to an employment agreement, your company name is accurate. The e-mail address is used to electronically sign the assignment agreement, so it too has to be accurate.

If the information's right, [send it to Outercurve Foundation to start the process of signing an assignment agreement](/development/assignment-agreement/send/). Otherwise, [update your profile information on GitHub)](https://github.com/settings/profile).
