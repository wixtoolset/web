## WiX Toolset Contribution License Agreement

The WiX toolset copyright is held by the [.NET Foundation][dnf].
Before we can accept any contributions you must have a [Contribution License Agreement][cla] on file.
Fortunately the process is very easy.

When you submit your first pull request, there will be a prompt to accept the CLA in the comments.
After reading the CLA you can accept it by responding with a comment saying `I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA`.
This will only necessary for your first pull request.

So go out there!
Participate in design discussions.
Get your code written.
Post the pull request for code reviewe.
Then respond to the CLA prompt and your contribution will be ready to be merged into the WiX toolset.

Happy coding!
