Additionally, the domain                     should be minimized as much as possible (for example, remove "www." prefix if unnecessary).<br/><br/>                    For example, the WiX toolset regid is "wixtoolset.org".                   </td>

Set this attribute to 'no'                     to indicate the software id tag is installed to a 32-bit location (such as "ProgramFilesFolder") or 'yes' when the tag is                     installed to a 64-bit location (such as "ProgramFiles64Folder"). The default default value is based on the platform set by                     the -arch switch to candle.exe or the InstallerPlatform property in a .wixproj MSBuild project:                     For x86 and ARM, the default value is 'no'.                     For x64 and IA64, the default value is 'yes'.<br/><br/>                    This attribute is only allowed on a Tag element found under a Product element.                   </td>
