  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>         Represents a DLL or assembly to be registered with COM+. If         this element is a child of a ComPlusApplication element, the assembly will be         registered in this application. Other ways the Application attribute must be         set to an application. The element must be a descendent of a Component element,         it can not be a child of a ComPlusApplication locator element.       </dd>

  <dd><p xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">             When installing a native assembly, all components             contained in the assembly must be represented as ComPlusComponent elements             under this element. Any component not listed will not be removed during             uninstall.           </p><p xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">             The fields DllPath, TlbPath and PSDllPath are formatted             fields that should contain file paths to there respective file types. A typical             value for DllPath for example, should be something like “[#MyAssembly_dll]”,             where “MyAssembly_dll” is the key of the dll file in the File table.           </p><p xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Warning</b>: The assembly name provided in the AssemblyName             attribute must be a fully specified assembly name, if a partial name is             provided a random assembly matching the partial name will be selected.           </p></dd>
