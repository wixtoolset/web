  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>                 Remove an empty folder if the parent component is selected for installation or removal.  By default, the folder                 is the directory of the parent component.  This can be overridden by specifying the Directory attribute                 with a value corresponding to the Id of the directory, or by specifying the Property attribute with a value                 corresponding to a property that will have a value that resolves to the full path of the folder.             </dd>

For 'install', the folder will be removed only when the parent component is being installed (msiInstallStateLocal or                         msiInstallStateSource); for 'uninstall', the folder will be removed only when the parent component                         is being removed (msiInstallStateAbsent); for 'both', the folder will be removed in both cases.                     </td>

The property does not have                     to exist in the installer database at creation time; it could be created at installation time by a custom                     action, on the command line, etc.  This attribute cannot be specified in conjunction with the Directory attribute.                 </td>
