  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>                 Copy or move an existing file on the target machine, or copy a file that is being installed, to another destination.  When                 this element is nested under a File element, the parent file will be installed, then copied to the specified destination                 if the parent component of the file is selected for installation or removal.  When this element is nested under                 a Component element and no FileId attribute is specified, the file to copy or move must already be on the target machine.                 When this element is nested under a Component element and the FileId attribute is specified, the specified file is installed,                 then copied to the specified destination if the parent component is selected for installation or removal (use                 this option to control the copy of a file in a different component by the parent component's installation state).  If the                 specified destination directory is the same as the directory containing the original file and the name for the proposed source                 file is the same as the original, then no action takes place.             </dd>

If a long file name is specified, the DestinationLongName attribute may not be specified.                   Also, if this value is a long file name, the DestinationShortName attribute may be omitted to                   allow WiX to attempt to generate a unique short file name.                   However, if this name collides with another file or you wish to manually specify                   the short file name, then the DestinationShortName attribute may be specified.                 </td>
