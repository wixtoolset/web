title: WiX v4.x features should be planned
draft: false

## User stories

* As a WiX developer I can plan features for WiX v4.x such that WiX v4.x releases are smooth.


## Proposal

This WIP exists for the purpose of tracking work that's been proposed for WiX v4.x. For each feature, we need to know:

* **Target** version of WiX. Features might need to come in v4.0 because they're breaking changes. Others are internal or invisible changes and could come in any v4.x release. Some changes might come in multiple phases across multiple v4.x releases.
* **Status**: Features go through a typical workflow on their way from an idea to merged pull request. Use one of the following:
  * Proposed
  * WIP draft
  * Wix-devs discussion
  * Coding in progress
  * Pull request in progress
  * Complete
* **People**: Who's working on the feature. A feature might be driven and implemented by one person or multiple people could split work on the WIP and code and documentation and TPS reports.
