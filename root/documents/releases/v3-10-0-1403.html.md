* BobArnson: WIXBUG:4662 - Add WIX_IS_NETFRAMEWORK_4XX_OR_LATER_INSTALLED SetProperty custom actions to WixNetfxExtension.
* BobArnson: WIXBUG:4611 - Eliminate mysteriously doubled .pkgdef content.
* BobArnson: WIXBUG:4610 - Write RegisterPerfmonManifest CustomActionData correctly.
* BobArnson: WIXBUG:4589 - Catch exceptions from Version when passing in arbitrary strings. For bundles, try to recover a three-part version number.
* STunney: WIXBUG:4187 - Melt doesn't export Binary or Icon tables
* BobArnson: WIXBUG:4553 - Fix Lux generator to exclude any files with non-fragment sections. Fix Lux custom actions to have proper config.
* PhillHogland: WIXBUG:4592 - Register named process, in another user's context with Restart Manager.  If Access Denied, continue install rather than fail.
* BobArnson: **BREAKING CHANGE** Changed bundle version to Major.Minor.0.BuildNumber. This allows us to publish updates as Major.Minor.(GreaterThanZero).BuildNumber. MSI product version numbers remain Major.Minor.BuildNumber so major upgrades continue to work. This bundle will not upgrade from build v3.10.1124.0. If you've installed v3.10.1124.0, you must uninstall before installing a later bundle.
* BMurri: WIXBUG:3750 - Add LaunchWorkingFolder to wixstdba to facilitate processes that require a different working folder.
* SeanHall: WIXBUG:4609 - Fix incorrect use of BVariantCopy by creating the new method BVariantSetValue.
* SeanHall: WIXBUG:4608 - Fix bug in mbapreq where it wouldn't reload the bootstrapper if there was a mix of installed and uninstalled prerequisites.
